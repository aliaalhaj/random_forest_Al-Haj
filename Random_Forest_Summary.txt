Random-forest: 
Random forest helps determine how well sequence variants group according to individual factors as determined by the metadata file. It does this by employing an ensemble of uncorrelated decision tree models that eventually converge on the grouping. The heat map provides a visual representation of this grouping. Random forest does not indicate statistical differences among groups.
